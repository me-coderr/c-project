# 1. Instead of asking for the input from user, populate MatrixA and MatrixB by digits 0-9. Then multiply
and store result into MatrixC and display.
2. Increase the order of MatrixA and MatrixB as 100x100,1000x1000  and perform multiplication. Is
there any difficulty in these cases? Calculate the time and space taken by each of the multiplication.
3. Consider the order to be nxn where n is in {10000,100000,1000000} and repeat the above exercise.
Put the times in a single graph paper for all n.
4. Write a program to reverse the elements of an array without using any other variable.
5.. Write a program to add two polynomials using array. Minimize the memory usage as much as you
can.
6. Write a program to check whether a matrix is i) identity, ii) diagonal.
For all programs (8-11) print the triple representation of the matrices in row column sorted manner.
8. Write a program to manipulate the triplet format of the matrix to find the transpose.
9. Write a program to add two matrices using triplet representation.
10. Write a program to multiply two matrices using triplet representation.
11. Write a SortMerge() function that takes two lists, each of which is unsorted. This program will sort
the lists in increasing order, and merges the two together into one list which is also in increasing order.
SortMerge() should return the new list.
Input : List1:9,5,3,10,11 and List2: 20,11,21,5,7
Output: Listres: 3,5,7,9,10,11,20,21
** It omits the duplicate entries.
12. Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a new list representing the intersection
of the two lists. The new list should be made with its own memory — the original lists should not be
changed.
Input: List1: 3,5,7,9,10,11,12,21 and List2: 2,5,8,10,13,17,20,21,33
Output: List 5,10,21 If no common element it will show that msg.
13. Given a list, split it into two sublists — one for the front half, and one for the back half. If the number
of elements is odd, the extra element should go in the front list.
Input:-2 4 8 5 6 11 23
Output:- L12 4 8 5 and L26 11 23
14. Write a program to delete the last occurrence of a given character in a single linked list.

15. Write a program that prints the minimum and maximum element of a single linked list traversing the
list only once.
16. Reverse the list of elements in a singly linked list.
17. Reverse the list of elements in a circular linked list.
18. 1. Write a program to find all pairs of integers in the linked list whose sum is equal to a given
number.
Example:
Given number=7
LL: 3 2 8 1 6 4 11
This will return (3,4) and (6,1)
19. Write a program to remove duplicate nodes from a linked list.
Example:
LL: 3 4 2 3 6 3 4 5 2 2
Output: 3 4 2 6 5
20. Write a program to delete the middle element(s) of a linked list by traversing the list only once. If
the list contains odd number of elements, the n/2+1th element will be deleted. On the other hand, if it
contains even number of elements, you need to delete both n/2th and n/2+1 th elements.
